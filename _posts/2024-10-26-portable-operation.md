A few Roseland members operated portable on Saturday morning starting at 10 AM ET from [Bramhall Terrace at South Mountain Reservation](https://maps.app.goo.gl/wB3PrZ47D6CqHRXK8).  The setup wasfor 10 meters, SSB and digital (FT4 and FT8) using a legacy Realistic HTX-100 transceiver.  If you enjoy portable operations or just a pleasant time outdoors with friends, please consider joining us on a future portable operation.  We provide a table and some chairs, however it is recommended to bring a folding chair if possible for your comfort.

To locate us when you're on site, give a call on NE2S/R (EchoLink node KC2NJ-R) or 146.52 simplex.
