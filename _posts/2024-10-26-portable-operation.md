A few Roseland members operated portable on Saturday morning starting at 10 AM ET from [Bramhall Terrace at South Mountain Reservation](https://maps.app.goo.gl/wB3PrZ47D6CqHRXK8).  This week's setup was for 10 meters, SSB and digital (FT8) using a legacy (circa 1989) [Realistic HTX-100 25 watt transceiver](https://www.rigpix.com/rs-realistic/realistic_htx100.htm).  If you enjoy portable operations or just a pleasant time outdoors with friends, please consider joining us on a future portable operation.  We provide a table and some chairs, however it is recommended to bring a folding chair for your comfort.

To locate us during operation and/or when you're on site, give a call on NE2S/R (EchoLink node KC2NJ-R) or on 146.52 simplex.

Equipment list:
- Realistic HTX-100 10 meter transceiver.
- 12V 15Ah LiFePO4 Battery.
- Digirig Mobile PC to radio interface (for FT8).
- Laptop running Windows 10 and WSJT-X software
- GPS USB dongle for precise time synchronization (required for FT4/8 modes).
- Alinco electret condenser microphone (uses the Kenwood pinout standard), compatible with the HTX-100.
- Arborist throw line kit w/ 15oz throw bag (used to get the antenna rope high in the tree).
- 3/16 inch black dacron polyester rope.
- 10 meter dipole in a inverted V configuration.
- Various HTs for local communications such as talk-in.
- Folding table & chairs for a comfortable operating position.

We operated from 10 AM - 12:30 PM ET under the call sign [KB2SUL](https://www.qrz.com/db/KB2SUL) and made the following contacts:<br/><br/>
