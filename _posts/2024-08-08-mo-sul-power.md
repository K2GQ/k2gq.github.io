In the mid-afternoon of a recent day, the routine of the Union County suburbs was interrupted by an unexpected power outage. As the power cut disrupted daily activities, one amateur radio operator, relying on the dependable NE2S repeater (146.595 MHz), reached out for information using a handheld transceiver (HT) on battery power. This event highlights not only the resilience of amateur radio in times of crisis but also the critical role operators play in supporting each other during such disruptions.

The complexity of the power grid in New Jersey presents a unique challenge. Unlike more centralized systems, the grid here is split among several service companies. This fragmentation often makes it difficult to quickly ascertain which provider is responsible for a specific outage. Fellow operators, left in the dark both literally and figuratively, frequently turn to amateur radio for real-time information.

Fortunately, there are tools available to bridge this information gap. One particularly useful resource is the Outage Tracker website, sponsored by nj.com and NJ Advance Media. This site provides a comprehensive and up-to-date map of power outages, allowing users to pinpoint affected areas and identify the responsible service providers. The website, accessible at [https://projects.nj.com/data/outagetracker/](https://projects.nj.com/data/outagetracker/), serves as an invaluable asset for amateur radio operators who can relay this information to those in need.

By utilizing this website, amateur radio operators can enhance their role as community informants. When an operator like the one on NE2S reaches out during an outage, having immediate access to accurate and current data allows for a swift and effective response. This capability not only reassures fellow operators but also helps in coordinating any necessary actions or further communications with service providers.

The NE2S repeater itself is a pillar of reliability in these situations. Known for its robust performance and emergency power capabilities, NE2S ensures that communication lines remain open even when the grid fails. Its local focus and dependable service make it an ideal platform for emergency communications, further cementing its role as a critical resource during power outages.

In times of crisis, the value of amateur radio is immeasurable. Operators who are well-informed and equipped with the right tools can make a significant difference in their communities. By leveraging resources like the Outage Tracker website and the reliability of the NE2S repeater, we can ensure that our fellow operators receive the information and support they need when it matters most.
