ARRL Field Day is just around the corner, taking place on the weekend of June 22-23. This is an exciting opportunity to practice our amateur radio skills and connect with other enthusiasts. There are many ARRL Field Day sites operating in our area, and you can find a location near you using the ARRL Field Day Locator [here](https://www.arrl.org/field-day-locator). ARRL Field Day is a great chance to test our equipment, refine our techniques, and enjoy the camaraderie of fellow operators.

Additionally, ARC Squared and WEARC extend a warm invitation to everyone from Roseland ARC to operate with them at the Northern NJ Red Cross Field Day site at [209 Fairfield Road, Fairfield, New Jersey](https://www.google.com/maps/place/40%C2%B052'43.6%22N+74%C2%B017'37.8%22W/@40.8787634,-74.2951209,296m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m4!3m3!8m2!3d40.8787634!4d-74.2938334?entry=ttu). This joint event promises to be an excellent experience, offering a chance to work together, share knowledge, and have a great time. Whether you're a seasoned operator or new to the hobby, your participation will make this event even more special. We look forward to seeing you there!
