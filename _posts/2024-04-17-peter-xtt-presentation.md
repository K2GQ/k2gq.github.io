In April, our club had the pleasure of hosting a presentation by Peter Summers, call sign N2XTT. Peter introduced us to NetLogger, a powerful tool for amateur radio operators, especially those involved in HF (High Frequency) communications.

<br />

### Introduction to NetLogger

Peter emphasized the simplicity and utility of NetLogger. It's freely available online, and once installed, users can log in with their call signs and immediately begin monitoring and logging contacts. This tool is essential for participating in various nets, including traffic, weather, and social nets.

### Understanding HF Operations

Peter shared his insights on HF frequencies, which, despite being termed "high frequency," actually operate on lower frequencies than VHF and UHF. He detailed the types of equipment needed for HF operations, highlighting the importance of having a good HF radio and understanding the specific bands like 80m, 40m, and 20m.

### Practical Demonstrations

Throughout the presentation, Peter provided practical demonstrations on how to use NetLogger effectively. He showed us how to find and select nets, log contacts, and use features like the AIM window to communicate with net control stations. He also touched on the nuances of remote operations and the importance of QSL cards for confirming contacts.

### Advancing in Amateur Radio

Peter shared his journey from obtaining his tech license to becoming a general and then an extra class operator. He discussed the challenges and rewards of mastering Morse code and progressing through the ranks in amateur radio. His stories about participating in various nets, earning awards, and the camaraderie within the community were truly inspiring.

### Engagement and Interaction

The session was highly interactive, with attendees asking questions and sharing their experiences. Peter addressed concerns about equipment, antenna setups, and the logistics of operating from different locations, including mobile and remote stations. His advice on dealing with practical challenges, like setting up antennas in restricted environments, was particularly valuable.

### Conclusion

Peter Summers' presentation was a comprehensive introduction to NetLogger and HF operations. His expertise and enthusiasm made the session engaging and informative, providing both new and seasoned operators with practical knowledge and inspiration to enhance their amateur radio experience. If you missed the presentation, consider downloading Net Logger and exploring its features to elevate your HF operations. Happy logging and 73!
