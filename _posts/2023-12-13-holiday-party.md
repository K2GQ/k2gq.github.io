On the evening of December 13th, the Roseland Amateur Radio Club gathered at Frank's Pizza in Roseland for a special holiday dinner.  The event began with a brief club meeting; this was an opportunity for the members to discuss club matters, plan upcoming activities, and share updates. The meeting set a tone of community and collaboration, integral to the spirit of our club.

Following the meeting, members exchanged knowledge, experiences, and ideas about various aspects of amateur radio. From discussing the latest in radio technology to sharing anecdotes from their radio operations and experimentation, the conversation was both enlightening and entertaining.

The highlight of the evening was, of course, the dinner at Frank's Pizza.  The club enjoyed a variety of pizzas and drinks, ideal for toasting to the holiday season and the joy of gathering together.  To round off the meal, a refreshing ice cream cake was served. It was the perfect ending to an evening shared among friends.

As the event drew to a close, it was evident that it was enjoyed by all. The combination of a warm and inviting atmosphere, engaging conversation, delicious food, and the shared appreciation for amateur radio made this holiday dinner a memorable one.
