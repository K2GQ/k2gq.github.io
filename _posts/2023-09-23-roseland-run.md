On Saturday, September 23 2023, the Roseland Amateur Radio Club assisted the Borough of Roseland with public safety communications for the annual Run for the Roses event.  The weather was gloomy and cool, but the rains held out long enough to get the race in safely.  We used 2 meter simplex to communicate, and communication was clear and effective across the entire race course.  Thank you to all club members who came out early Saturday morning and helped to make this event a success.
