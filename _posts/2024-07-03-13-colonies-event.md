### Celebrate Independence with the 13 Colonies Special Event

Every year, amateur radio operators across the globe eagerly anticipate the 13 Colonies Special Event. Held annually from July 1 to July 7, this event commemorates America's original thirteen colonies and celebrates the rich history of the United States.

#### What is the 13 Colonies Special Event?

The 13 Colonies Special Event is a unique amateur radio activity where operators aim to contact special event stations representing each of the original thirteen colonies: Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, and Virginia. Additionally, three bonus stations—WM3PEN in Philadelphia, representing the Liberty Bell, TM13COL in France, and GB13COL in the United Kingdom—are also active during the event.

#### How to Participate

Participation is straightforward. Operators need search the HF bands and try to make contact with the special event stations. These stations will be using unique call signs such as K2A (New York), K2B (Virginia), and so on, making it an exciting challenge to collect all thirteen colonies.

For those who successfully contact at least some of the thirteen colonies, a beautiful certificate is available. Contacting the bonus stations adds an extra layer of achievement, with separate endorsements available for those who manage to include WM3PEN, TM13COL, and GB13COL in their logs.

#### Special Event QSL Cards and Certificates

One of the highlights of the event is the opportunity to receive commemorative QSL cards and a certificate. Each special event station provides a unique QSL card, often featuring historical imagery related to the colony they represent. Collecting these cards has become a cherished tradition among amateur radio enthusiasts.
