### Introducing EchoLink Web: Software Client not Required

This latest edition of EchoLink is designed to simplify your radio experience, allowing you to connect and communicate with other operators worldwide without the need for dedicated software installation. Here's a quick guide on what EchoLink Web offers and how you can get started.

#### What is EchoLink Web?

EchoLink Web is a browser-based version of the popular EchoLink software, enabling users to operate EchoLink directly from their web browsers. Whether you're using Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or any other major browser, EchoLink Web works seamlessly across different operating systems. There's no need to download or install any applications; all it takes is a click to start communicating.

#### Getting Started with EchoLink Web

To dive into the world of EchoLink Web, simply navigate to [webapp.echolink.org](https://webapp.echolink.org). You'll need your existing EchoLink callsign (make sure it's in single-user mode, without the -L or -R suffix) and password to log in. If your callsign hasn't been validated yet, the website will guide you through the validation process. Should you encounter an "incorrect password" message, you can easily reset your EchoLink password on the Validation page.

#### Permissions and Functionality

Upon launching EchoLink Web, you might be prompted to allow the use of your microphone. Granting microphone access is essential for transmitting; however, you can still receive transmissions if you choose to deny permission. 

Once logged in, connecting to another station is straightforward. To start transmitting, either click on the Transmit button or press and hold the space bar. Remember, you can only transmit when the EchoLink Web page is actively in use on your screen.
