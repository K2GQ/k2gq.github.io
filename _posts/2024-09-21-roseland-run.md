On Saturday, September 21 2024, the Roseland Amateur Radio Club assisted the Borough of Roseland with public safety communications for the annual Run for the Roses event.  The weather was sunny and cool, perfect weather for a running event.  We used 70 centimeter simplex to communicate, and communication was clear and effective across the entire race course.  Thank you to all club members who came out early Saturday morning and helped to make this event a success.
