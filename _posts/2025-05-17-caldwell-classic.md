# Roseland ARC Supports the 2025 Caldwell Classic 5K

**CALDWELL, NJ — Saturday, May 17, 2025**
A cool, overcast morning set the stage for this year’s **Caldwell Classic 5K Run/Walk & Family Fun Run**, where more than 1,000 participants took to the streets in a celebration of community, fitness, and fun. Among the many volunteers helping make the event a success, the **Roseland Amateur Radio Club** was once again proud to provide race-day communication support.

## Behind the Scenes: Ham Radio in Action

Roseland ARC volunteers were stationed across the race course, ensuring that organizers had reliable communication from start to finish. Utilizing **2-meter simplex VHF**, hams maintained real-time contact between checkpoints, the finish line, and safety personnel. With the course winding through local neighborhoods, the club's use of simplex frequencies proved effective and efficient, providing clear coverage with minimal interference.

In one notable instance, operators helped race organizers respond quickly to a logistical hiccup: a water station was missing its supplies shortly before race time. Thanks to quick communication between Roseland hams and course volunteers, the issue was relayed and resolved promptly—ensuring water was delivered just in time for the first wave of runners.

“This kind of event is a great example of how amateur radio operators can provide practical, real-world support,” said one Roseland ARC volunteer on site. “Everything ran smoothly—we had strong signals across the course and didn’t miss a beat.”

## Ideal Conditions for Runners and Radios

The day began in the low 60s, with overcast skies creating a perfect environment for runners—not too hot, and no harsh sun to battle. While many runners focused on shaving seconds off their personal bests, others took part in the more relaxed Family Fun Run, walking or jogging alongside children and friends.

Meanwhile, the Roseland ARC team was keeping tabs on everything from medical check-ins to the tail-end sweeper vehicle. It’s the kind of quiet contribution that goes largely unnoticed—but one that’s absolutely essential to the safe and smooth operation of any large-scale race.

## A Tradition of Service

This marks another successful public service outing for Roseland ARC, whose members regularly volunteer at regional races and community events. These activities aren’t just about radio—they’re a chance to practice emergency preparedness, demonstrate the value of amateur radio to the public, and engage with the community in a meaningful way.

The club would like to thank the **Caldwell-West Caldwell Education Foundation (CWCEF)**, the **race organizers**, and the **runners and families** who made this event a success. We look forward to seeing everyone again next year!
