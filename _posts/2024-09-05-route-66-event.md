**Celebrate History and Amateur Radio at the 2024 Route 66 On the Air Event**

If you’re a fan of amateur radio and American history, mark your calendar for September 7–15, 2024, because the annual Route 66 On the Air event is right around the corner. Organized by the Citrus Belt Amateur Radio Club (CBARC), this beloved tradition is not only a celebration of the legendary Route 66 but also an exciting opportunity for hams around the world to get on the air, connect with fellow operators, and embrace a little piece of American nostalgia.

### What Is Route 66 On the Air?

For over two decades, amateur radio operators have been taking to the airwaves to commemorate the historical significance of Route 66, the “Main Street of America.” Stretching from Chicago, Illinois, to Santa Monica, California, this iconic highway symbolizes the American spirit of freedom, adventure, and the open road.

The Route 66 On the Air event is organized by CBARC, based in San Bernardino, California, one of the cities that Route 66 passes through. This weeklong event allows radio operators, also known as "chasers," to connect with special event stations located along the highway, each bearing distinctive 1x1 callsigns like W6A through W6U, corresponding to the states Route 66 traverses.

### Event Highlights

1. **Unique Callsigns and Locations**: Operators can reach stations representing key cities along the historic route. Each station is hosted by local amateur radio clubs, which make contacts under unique callsigns such as W6A (Chicago, Illinois) through W6U (Santa Monica, California). This not only brings a sense of geographical connection but also offers the thrill of collecting as many stations as possible throughout the event.
   
2. **All Bands, All Modes**: Whether you're into HF, VHF, or digital modes, there’s something for everyone. The event is open to all amateur radio bands and operating modes, making it accessible to a wide range of operators with different equipment and preferences. This inclusivity is one of the key factors contributing to the event’s popularity.
   
3. **Certificates and Fun Prizes**: For many participants, collecting contacts with as many Route 66 stations as possible is a fun and rewarding challenge. Once the event is over, operators can apply for a commemorative certificate to celebrate their achievements. Additionally, each participating station offers unique QSL cards, which are highly sought after by ham radio collectors.

4. **Historical Connection**: Route 66 represents a significant chapter in American history. Created in 1926, this highway linked small towns, spurred economic growth, and became a symbol of hope for those migrating west during the Dust Bowl and Great Depression. The Route 66 On the Air event lets you embrace this history while engaging in one of your favorite hobbies.

### How to Get Involved

Participation in the event is straightforward and open to all licensed operators. The stations will operate across a variety of modes, including SSB, CW, and digital, ensuring that everyone has an opportunity to join in. CBARC’s website offers detailed guidance on how to find the stations, what frequencies to monitor, and how to submit your QSL cards.

The easiest way to get started is to familiarize yourself with the callsigns representing each Route 66 city, scan the bands during the event dates, and make those contacts! You can also follow live updates via DX clusters or online spotting networks, helping you track down the stations you need to complete your Route 66 collection.

### A Celebration of Both Radio and Americana

For seasoned operators and newcomers alike, the Route 66 On the Air event is a fun and unique way to combine a love for amateur radio with a tribute to one of America’s most famous highways. Whether you’re looking to relive the golden era of Route 66 or just enjoy the thrill of working rare stations, this event is an annual highlight on the amateur radio calendar.

So, warm up your rig, tune in, and get ready to hit the road—on the airwaves, that is!
