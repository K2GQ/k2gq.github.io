4. **Scams & Fraud Alerts:**  
   - Several participants shared recent scam experiences, from fraudulent phone numbers posing as GEICO to fake Apple support calls.  
   - Emphasis was placed on recognizing phishing attempts and avoiding sharing personal information over the phone.

5. **Medical Trivia & Fun Questions:**

### **Moment of the Net:**  
The funniest moment of the net happened when a participant, while discussing medical trivia, joked about how pain leads people to the doctor, then followed up with:  

*"A guy walks into the doctor's office and says, â€˜Every time I raise my right hand, it hurts!â€™ The doctor looks at him and says, â€˜Then donâ€™t raise your right hand!â€™"*  

The groan-worthy joke got a good laugh from the group, making it the standout moment of the evening.  

**Closing Remarks:**  
The net wrapped up with 73s all around, encouragement to join the morning coffee chat on the repeater, and a reminder that spring is just around the corner.  

Thanks to everyone who participatedâ€”until next week!
