**Net date: Tuesday, March 18**

### Community Net Weekly Summary – March 18  

Spring is knocking, the bees are buzzing, and the radios are crackling with activity—welcome to another **St. Barnabas Hosted Community Net!** This week’s session had everything: technical deep dives, radio sales, philosophical riddles, and even a brand-new ham making waves from Staten Island!  

#### 🎙️ Roll Call & A Staten Island Surprise  
Check-ins started strong with hams joining via RF and Echolink, but one operator had a little more adventure than expected. A participant from Staten Island Technical High School checked in—eventually—after battling a technical gremlin. Turns out, their J-Pole antenna was solid, but the radio settings weren’t quite right, and they were trying to check in on simplex instead of the repeater input. Once they got it sorted, their 50-watt signal made it through, which is no small feat considering the hills and valleys in between.  

Their check-in sparked some fun technical chatter, with others discussing the tricky topography of the area and whether a Yagi antenna might be a good experiment. Another operator pointed out that mobile signals from Staten Island had struggled earlier in the day, but a properly placed rooftop antenna made all the difference.  

#### 🛠️ Equipment Talk: The Bargain Bin & A New Toy  
There was a little ham radio shopping spree happening, too. Someone put up a Yaesu FT-60R for $100, and a DMR UHF radio still in the box for a bargain $50—practically giving the thing away. No word on whether a bidding war broke out, but those deals were tempting.  

Meanwhile, one participant shared their excitement about purchasing a Xiegu G90 HF transceiver. This little rig packs 20 watts of punch and even has a built-in tuner, making it perfect for mobile HF ops. The plan? Stick an antenna on the car and hit the road with some HF action. This, of course, led to some good-natured ribbing about how they should just install a 100-foot wire on the roof rack and “see what happens.”  

#### 🛑 The Riddle That Stumped the Net  
Every good net needs a mental workout, and one participant delivered with this brain-bender:  
*“What question can you never say yes to?”*  

The guesses started rolling in, with one operator confidently declaring the answer was, *“Are you a liar?”* The logic? If you say yes, then you’re a liar, which means you’re lying about being a liar, so… uh… yeah. Brain meltdown initiated.  

But the real answer was revealed to be: *“Are you asleep?”* Cue the groans, laughter, and light existential crisis.  

#### 🐝 Bees, Hamfests & Red Cross Operations  
Spring fever is real, and the hams are feeling it. The crocuses are popping, the forsythias are glowing yellow, and one operator had a full-blown moment with a bee on their windshield. Instead of swatting it, they slowed down, spoke to it like an old friend, and let it fly away. Good karma achieved.  

Two big events are coming up:  
📻 **Parsippany Hamfest** – Radios, parts, mystery gear, and maybe some old chassis with outrageous price tags.  
🏠 **Red Cross Operating Event** – If everything lines up, the WEARC club will fire up some HF and digital modes at their Fairfield station.  

There was some last-minute wheeling and dealing over who’s going where, and whether anyone needs a ride (or just a good excuse to spend money on radio gear).  

#### 👋 Wrapping Up: See You Next Time!  
As the net wound down, everyone shared final thoughts, weekend plans, and 73s. One last call for check-ins came up empty—either everyone was already in bed, or they were too busy looking up the Xiegu G90.  

The repeater was returned to normal use, and just like that, another great net was in the books. Same time, same place next week—bring your radios, riddles, and maybe a little more antenna gain if you're calling in from Staten Island.  

🔥 73 and keep the airwaves lively! 🔥

**Net date: Tuesday, March 25**

### Community Net Weekly Summary – March 25

🌐 **Community Net – March 25, 2025 Recap** 🎙️  
*Live from the RF airwaves and EchoLink alike, this week’s social net was buzzing with early spring energy, plant pride, a little radio troubleshooting, and more than a few laughs.*

### 🧠 **Insightful Highlights**

Spring has officially arrived—and it seems to have brought half the garden with it.

This week’s roundtable touched on everything from weather predictions (an optimistic 80°F forecast!) to propagation prep and a new local net. Operators shared their gardening projects, tech hiccups, and upcoming events—all in the true spirit of amateur radio camaraderie.

A key update: the repeater will begin hosting the **Essex County ARES Net** starting in April. This net will meet **monthly on the second Thursday at 8 PM Eastern**, open to *anyone* interested in emergency communications, regardless of whether they live in Essex County or are officially part of ARES.

Meanwhile, one operator ran into a CW keying issue on his Icom rig. That sparked an on-air diagnostic brainstorm session that included everything from checking jacks, toggling between keyer modes, and confirming settings like full break-in vs. semi-break-in. Even a GPT-generated troubleshooting list made its way into the mix—turns out AI is now joining the roundtable, too.

### 🌼 **Gardening Goes Ham**

You’d be forgiven for thinking this was a gardening club with a side of RF. Spring had everyone talking soil and sprouts:

- Rhubarb was just peeking above ground with its tiny, crinkled leaves.
- A Wiri pepper plant passed from neighbor to neighbor like a VIP seedling.
- Milkweed was going in to attract monarchs, while tree seedlings from the Arbor Day Foundation were being carefully potted.
- Butterfly bushes, cucumber vines, and tomato dreams filled the air—along with questions about overwintering potted plants in garages or basements.

Even hams who swore off plants after childhood yard chores were reconsidering after hearing all the buzz.

And just to drive home how deep the veggie rabbit hole goes: someone looked up the number of known tomato varieties—over **10,000**! That’s not a typo. (By comparison, cucumbers only have about 100. Sorry, cucumbers.)

### 💬 **Engaging Exchanges**

The recent in-person meetup at the Red Cross facility got high praise. Operators shared stories of operating CW, socializing over radios, and tossing around ideas like returning to the club after the upcoming Splitrock Hamfest in May for more radio fun.

A few folks also shared their experiences with family members in the hospital or recovering from illness. The group sent warm wishes and showed support, as always. This net doesn’t just build antennas—it builds community.

And yes, there was a *very* gentle roast when someone kept mixing up two operators with very different call signs and hometowns—because, as it turns out, everyone taller than you starts to look the same after a while.

### 🧩 **Trivia Time!**

One participant dropped a classic riddle that left most scratching their heads:  
**“What kind of room has no doors or windows?”**  

The correct answer—supplied by one operator’s better half—was:  
**“A mushroom.”**  

It landed well, especially with folks planning to test it out on their grandkids.

### 🛠️ **Marketplace & Odds ‘n Ends**

- A lightly used **Yaesu FTM-7250DR** was offered up for $200.
- Trenton Computer Festival was mentioned as an upcoming event. Fun fact: someone spotted an Einstein impersonator at a related meeting… which is somehow *exactly* what you’d expect at a Princeton-area tech gathering.
- Reminder: when selling gear at a hamfest, maybe don’t price it like it’s museum-grade if you're serious about letting it go!

### 🌱 **Final Thoughts**

The net wrapped with a few last garden notes, a mini botany lesson on hybrid tomato plants, and more spring optimism. While some signed off early with warm 73s, others lingered, soaking up the vibe of a group that knows how to mix RF with TLC.

The weekly St. Barnabas Net continues to be a place for more than just signal reports—it's where technical minds meet big hearts, with a dash of humor and homegrown tomatoes on the side.

See you next week! And hey, don’t forget your flip-flops—it might actually *hit 80 degrees.*

**Net date: Tuesday, April 1**

### Community Net Weekly Summary – April 1
<br/>
### 🌐 Community Net Recap – April 1, 2025

April Fool's Day might be built for pranks, but the only thing this net fooled us with was how quickly two hours could fly by. The **St. Barnabas Community Net** once again proved why Tuesday nights on the repeater are anything but boring. We had a mix of seasoned voices, fresh check-ins, storm recaps, gardening tips, and even a riddle to stump the room.

### ✅ Check-Ins and First-Timers
The net kicked off with a warm welcome to both **EchoLink** and **RF** stations, including several familiar check-ins and a brand-new licensee from Mendham using a handheld. Great to see new folks jumping into the hobby—and they even scored the lucky number seven in the round table!

### 🌦️ Weather Tales and Lightning Shows
Much of the net reflected on the dramatic thunderstorms from the night before. One operator reported "lightning bolts so thick it was unbelievable," while another checked a local rain gauge and measured about an inch of rain. Not catastrophic, but enough to ease some ongoing drought concerns. As someone aptly put it, “Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain”—which may now be our official spring anthem.

### 🍻 Beer, Birds, and Backyard Experiments
- One participant’s **2004 Honda Civic** air conditioner miraculously still works—cause for celebration!
- A future BBQ was teased, featuring microbrew beer from Toms River—just waiting on a sunny Saturday.
- Sightings of robins, blue jays, and cardinals confirmed that spring is officially in the air.
- There's a gardening experiment underway with **dehydrated soil** and the growing of **weary pepper plants**, which may eventually be turned into homemade hot sauce.
- A plug was made for NJ’s Pequest Fish Hatchery and the joys of trout season—perfectly timed with others sharing their fly-fishing backgrounds.

### 📻 Gear Talk and Club Happenings
Someone shared news of a **DMR UHF handheld radio** for sale—boxed, barely used, and priced at just $50. It's a great deal, complete with charger and reportedly one of the best speakers on a handheld.

Mentions were made of the upcoming **club meeting** (both in person and online), and a reminder that **ARRL Field Day** is just three months away. Never too early to start planning!

### 🧠 Moment of the Net: The Riddle Showdown
This week’s **“Moment of the Net”** goes to the classic riddle:
> **"What can travel around the world without leaving its corner?"**  
> _Answer: A stamp._

That stumped a few folks and kicked off a spirited debate. An alternate answer was floated: **the North and South Poles**—always in their corner, yet central to global rotation. But the original riddle won out in the end.

Best of all? The closing pun:  
> _"I’ll put my **stamp of approval** on all of tonight."_

Well played.

### 💬 Final Thoughts
As always, the net wrapped up with warm 73s, light-hearted banter, and an open invitation to stick around for more socializing. There was even a reminder to check your **tire pressure**—because with changing spring temps, that PSI can sneak up on you.

**Net date: Tuesday, April 8**

### Community Net Weekly Summary – April 8
<br/>

## 🎙️ Community Net Recap – April 8, 2025

They say time flies when you're having fun, and this Tuesday's edition of the St. Barnabas Community Net was a textbook case. We squeezed in **three full rotations** of stories, trivia, weather rants, garden updates, and net wisdom, all before the hour struck. Not bad for an “unofficial” spring night where the thermometer still thinks it’s January.

### 🌦️ Weather Whiplash Continues
This week’s theme? **Mother Nature is not ready to let go**. One moment it's crocuses blooming, the next it’s snow in the Berkshires and 24-degree wind chills. Even the “weather guy” on the net had to turn his heat back on. And yes, there were strong opinions about that.

Several net participants are clearly done with the cold, but others took time to appreciate the upside:
- **Rainy days** helped fill the rivers and ease lingering drought concerns.
- **Pollen haters** rejoiced with every drop.
- One person even timed their **fertilizer application** perfectly with a light rain. Now that’s efficiency.

### 🌸 Cherry Blossoms, Hot Dogs, and Hidden Parks
The discussion turned poetic as memories of **Branch Brook Park** came pouring in. With its stunning cherry blossoms and storied past, the park sparked some great nostalgia:
- Once home to the largest cherry blossom collection on the East Coast.
- Beloved for school field trips and family outings (though not everyone was thrilled about missing the swing sets).
- And yes, **JJ’s Hot Dog Truck**—still operating after three generations—got a shoutout and is officially now on everyone’s food pilgrimage list.

### 💻 Club Upgrades and Activities
Big tech news: a brand-new WEARC **club laptop** was acquired this week, complete with Ryzen 7, 16GB RAM, and a 15" screen. It’s destined for **FT8 operation** in the club station, and several operators are excited to get it configured and integrated.

A **new ground-wave HF coordination night** also kicked off—an informal Wednesday evening event for those who want to experiment with 10m, 40m, or whatever works. And in the public service realm, a monthly **Essex County ARES Net** is making its comeback this Thursday, April 10th and will take place each second Thursday of the month.

### 🎯 Moment of the Net: The Riddle & The Reveal
This week's **"Moment of the Net"** was all about brainpower:

> **Riddle:** "Spell me forward, I’m something you do every day. Spell me backward, I’m something you hate."

The answer? **LIVE / EVIL**  
Cue applause, texted guesses, and one very proud ham who relayed the correct answer from the home team. 🧠👏

### 🧪 Garden Experiments and Pest Battles
The growing season is beginning—sort of. Between hyacinths, daffodils, and tulips trying to bloom and persistent snow in higher elevations, it’s a waiting game. One participant reported their crocuses were "fighting to stay up" through a dusting of snow. Another confirmed the **black ants** have returned, staking their claim to the kitchen sink. Ah, spring.

And of course, the elusive **weary pepper** made another appearance—still germinating, still promising health benefits and fiery heat.

### 💡 Final Notes & Friendly Sign-Offs
The net wrapped with shoutouts, tech tips (Zoom > Skype for club meetings, FYI), and the universal truth that no one actually likes folding laundry. Also, dishes waited patiently while folks enjoyed just one more round. Priorities.

As always, this net served up connection, community, and a few surprises. See you next Tuesday—and don’t forget to keep your antenna up, your coffee hot, and your hot dog cravings ready. JJ’s, we’re coming for you. 🌭🌸

**Net date: Tuesday, April 15**

### Community Net Weekly Summary – April 15
<br/>

## 🎙️ St. Barnabas Community Net Recap – April 15, 2025

The **mid-April edition** of the St. Barnabas Community Net had it all—**sunshine, salmon mishaps, trivia twists, antenna advice, and the great Coffee Club rebrand.** With **eleven check-ins** spanning from New Jersey to Eastern Europe, this net once again reminded us that a repeater can be a window to the world.

### 🌞 Weather Watch: Shorts and Snowflakes
The weather took center stage again this week. While some participants declared it officially “shorts season” and got the grill going, others—especially those farther north—were watching snowflakes in the forecast. One operator shared that it was 58°F with clear skies, while another’s app showed snow arriving overnight. Go figure.

As one ham put it: “Mother Nature is still trying to decide if it’s spring or not.”

### 🍳 Farewell to the Coffee Club — Hello, Breakfast Club!
The **morning informal net**, long known as the “Coffee Club,” has officially rebranded itself as the **Breakfast Club** to reflect its international and time zone-flexible nature. After all, when one person’s sipping espresso, someone else might already be on their second glass of wine.  

The change also sparked a nostalgic dive into pop culture:
- Yes, the 1985 movie _The Breakfast Club_ came up (and yes, there was a debate over whether it was detention or summer school).
- Bonus trivia: the original **"Breakfast Club"** was actually a popular **radio program** in the 1950s, later simulcast on ABC TV.

🎵 _Cue Simple Minds: “Don’t You Forget About Me.”_

### 🧠 Moment of the Net: The Presidential Riddle
This week’s riddle barely had time to breathe before getting solved—turns out, the answer is a local celebrity:

> **“The 22nd and 24th U.S. Presidents had the same parents, but were not brothers. How is this possible?”**  
> _Answer: It’s the same person—Grover Cleveland!_

This week’s trivia question didn’t pose much of a challenge for this crew—especially given how familiar some are with **Grover Cleveland**. The moment the riddle was read, a correct answer followed swiftly, prompting knowing nods rather than puzzled silence. One participant even reminded us that the club has held events at the **Grover Cleveland Birthplace**, making this more of a memory jog than a brain teaser.

### 📡 Ham Radio Highlights
- A **new voice joined the net** this week, checking in via EchoLink for the first time and asking about the **ICOM 7300**—a popular and powerful HF rig. Plenty of advice followed, including suggestions to check Ham Radio Outlet and a reminder that antennas matter just as much.
- Another participant reported **200 FT8 contacts and 50 DX entities**—a huge milestone and a nice testament to propagation and patience.
- Milkweed plants arrived in the mail (yes, in a plastic bag), and the **butterfly project** is officially underway.
- A flowering plant called **ranunculus** sparked curiosity and horticultural admiration, proving yet again that this net is as much about **life as it is about radio**.

### 🔧 From the Shack to the Grill
The weekly chatter featured:
- **Grilling misfires** caused by high wind and unlit burners,
- Dreams of salmon on the deck,
- Barbecue flashbacks tied to boom box anthems,
- And yes, **dishwashing shifts** that had net control signing off temporarily.

### 🎉 Elder Wisdom and a Living Link to History
One of the most exciting moments came when an operator reported hearing from **a 90-year-old amateur**—licensed in **1952** and believed to be a **founding member of the St. Barnabas club**. Still living locally, he checked in recently with a decades-old HT.

There’s now talk of capturing his stories, interviewing him, and documenting this living history while we still can. As someone aptly put it, _“That’s a big part of amateur radio in this area—we need to preserve it.”_

### 💬 Final Thoughts
As the net wound down, operators shared well-wishes, commented on new rigs, announced upcoming travel plans to Cyprus, and gave thanks for the community they’ve found on the air.

And while not everyone agreed on what _The Breakfast Club_ was really about, we all agreed on this: barbecues, bumblebees, and bonding over the bands mean spring has truly arrived.

Catch the St. Barnabas Community Net every Tuesday at 7 PM. Come for the trivia, stay for the tulips—and don’t forget to say hi at the Breakfast Club. You might just walk away with a riddle, a rig recommendation, and a recipe for grilled salmon. 🐟🎙️🌼

### Community Net Weekly Summary – April 22
<br/>

## 🛰️ St. Barnabas Community Net Recap – April 22, 2025

Spring was in full swing on this week’s net, and so was the storytelling—from **riddles about bald guys**, to **Jack Daniel’s trivia**, to a surprise history lesson on **NASA on the Air**. We had **13 check-ins**, including a few fresh voices, a remote participant from Eastern Europe, and a Memphis operator who taught us more about Tennessee than any travel guide ever could.

---

### 🌤️ Weather Report: Bats, Barbecues, and Blooming Dogwoods
Everyone seemed to be soaking up the spring weather—literally. Between grill smoke, mosquito defense strategies, and blooming cherry trees, the airwaves were full of seasonal updates:
- Multiple operators were **grilling dinner live** during the net (chicken, steak, corn, salmon, spaghetti, and meatballs all made appearances).
- One backyard featured **bats on mosquito duty** while another had **pink dogwoods** and **cherry blossoms** in full bloom.
- Several reported highs in the **70s and 80s**, with one station dealing with a post-thunderstorm cooldown.

Let’s just say no one was complaining.

---

### 📡 Ham Happenings: Updates, QSL Cards, and Burned Finals
On the amateur radio front:
- One op is up to **228 contacts and 55 countries** on **FT8**—a strong showing for digital mode fans.
- Another shared memories of **a cross-country road trip** made more fun by making VHF contacts and receiving a stack of QSL cards upon returning home.
- A cautionary tale: One inexpensive mobile rig suffered **VHF final failure** after transmitting while sitting in direct sunlight. A reminder that even radios need shade sometimes.

### 🧠 The Riddle Returns
As is tradition, the net’s resident puzzler dropped a zinger:
> **“A man goes out in heavy rain with nothing to protect him. His hair doesn’t get wet—how?”**

The answer?  
**He’s bald.**  
(Which had everyone laughing and offering their own spin—“he dodged the raindrops” or “never left the building” were close contenders.)

One participant shared this gem:  
> _“I knew I was going bald when the shampoo started lasting longer and the face lotion ran out faster.”_

---

### 🎬 Pop Culture & Pour Decisions
The **Breakfast Club movie** got a callback this week, with one participant finally watching it and finding the ending “surprisingly deep.” The classic tune “Don’t You Forget About Me” earned nostalgic nods.

But the real plot twist? The net **pivoted into a spirited debate about Jack Daniel’s, Tennessee whiskey, bourbon, and whether carrot juice makes you less tolerant to hard liquor**. Consensus:
- Jack Daniel’s burns.
- Mixed with Coke, it’s tolerable.
- Carrot juice and tequila don’t mix.
- And yes, someone has tried a **pre-mixed Jack & Coke in a can**—but it just wasn’t the same.

---

### 🌄 Spotlight State: Tennessee Takes Center Stage
A newcomer from **Memphis** unknowingly sparked a full-blown cultural segment. Thanks to them, we learned:
- Tennessee is home to Moon Pies, Smoky Mountains, Graceland, Dolly Parton, Jack Daniel’s, George Dickel, barbecue, black bears, banjo circles, and yes— Davey Crockett.
- Memphis blues and Nashville country music got well-deserved recognition.
- As for the spaghetti and meatballs? Not exactly traditional Tennessee fare—but like any good Southern fusion, it just worked in the moment. Elvis probably would’ve approved. 🍝🎸

---

### 👨‍🔧 Tech Notes and PL Tones
A heads-up from net control: One participant experienced **PL tone issues** when switching from EchoLink to RF, leading to transmissions not carried by the repeater. A quick reminder to **check your PL (CTCSS) tone is 100.0 Hz** when participating in the tnet via the local VHF repeater.

---

### 🚀 Space Corner: NASA On The Air (NOTA)
Another op gave a heads-up about **NASA On The Air**, a special event honoring the first spaceflight. Multiple NASA-affiliated stations will be operating throughout early May—definitely worth chasing for the logbook.

---

### 🧼 Sign-Offs and 73s
As the sun set and the dishes loomed, participants signed off with their usual warmth:
- **“Nastrovia!”** from overseas.
- Cherry trees, bats, and long walks made it into the final round.
- Several folks are now **planning a trip to the liquor store to verify the existence of Tennessee whiskey**, as part of their amateur radio field research. Strictly for science, of course.

---

## 🔚 Final Thoughts
From QSL cards to QTH cuisine, this net had it all. Whether you're here for the tech tips, gardening updates, or spirited Southern banter, the **St. Barnabas Community Net** remains a place where hams gather, laugh, learn, and maybe even barbecue mid-transmission.

**See you next Tuesday at 7 PM. No hair required.** 😄🎙️🥃

### 🧠 Moment of the Net: The Riddle That Flipped the Room
This week's riddle stumped almost everyone:
> **“What five-letter word, typed in all capital letters, reads the same upside down?”**  
> _Answer: SWIMS_

The reactions ranged from **"Ohhh!"** to **"I would never have guessed!"** to one participant admitting:

Score another point for the Net’s resident riddle-master.

---

### 🏡 Antenna Adventures (and Attic Ambitions)
One participant asked for feedback on using **attic antennas for UHF and HF**, citing limitations like no trees and a spouse vetoing roof installations.

Responses included:
- “A few folks out here have done it successfully.”
- “YouTube has some helpful builds.”
- “It’s not ideal—but it can absolutely work.”

A few ops hinted they might try it themselves, so expect future reports on attic SWR.

---

### 🧱 Cobblestones, Construction, and Curious Paving Choices
A side conversation about tree removal sparked an unexpected history lesson:
- Several participants recalled when their **streets were repaved**, revealing pristine **cobblestones** underneath.
- One observed:

---

### 🥄 Life Beyond the Bands
Dinner was simmering across the net, including:
- Spaghetti and meatballs
- Mystery meals from family debates
- “Just two forks and a plate”—someone was clearly winning the dishes game

One op was **transfixed by a tree removal operation**, describing it like a **cirque du soleil of chainsaws**. Another reported three bats now **patrolling their backyard for mosquitoes**. Natural pest control!

---

## 📻 Final Notes and Sign-Offs

### Community Net Weekly Summary – May 6
<br/>

## 🌐 St. Barnabas Community Net Recap – May 6, 2025

Spring storms, root canals, riddle victories, tomatoes the size of dinner plates, and the return of a long-lost pool cue from a historic Orange bar… this net had it all. With check-ins from across New Jersey, New England, and even overseas, the St. Barnabas Net proved once again that Tuesday nights on the repeater are equal parts **community roundtable, horticultural update, and comedy hour**.

---

### 🌧️ Weather Report: All Rain, No Complaints

If you’re into **green grass and allergy meds**, this was your net. Nearly everyone reported heavy rain across the region, which meant:

* **No lawn mowing** (unless you’re riding on 12 volts),
* A **bloom bonanza** from tulips to daffodils to irises,
* And lots of gratitude for **not having to water plants**.

Of course, some weren’t thrilled about the return of cold nights in the 40s. But allergy sufferers (shout-out to Team Generic Claritin) were just glad the pollen was taking a break.

---

### 🍅 Tomatoes, Tulips & The Weary Pepper

The gardening chatter was rich and colorful:

* Some are growing **giant beefsteak tomatoes** ideal for covering an entire slice of rye.
* Others are patiently coaxing **weary peppers** to grow—reportedly one of the slowest germinating species known to mankind.
* There were detailed tulip updates from New England, including:

  > *“Purple so dark they’re nearly black, yellow ones that flop open like a smile, and pink ones with iridescent white streaks.”*
* A reminder was shared that **tulips often only bloom for 3–4 years**, while **irises last forever**—a budget tip for the backyard.

Also: tomatoes + grilled cheese + bacon = happiness. Bonus points if you add mayo.

---

### 🎸 Music Corner: Chicago, Canasta & The Sound of Silence

Musical mentions hit full stride this week:

* The group agreed on love for **Chicago**, **Earth, Wind & Fire**, and **The Eagles**.
* One op named *25 or 6 to 4* as his favorite Chicago track, though he still doesn’t know what it means. (Spoiler: it’s about songwriting at 3:34 a.m.)
* A participant with a **MIDI guitar** can now play piano using strings. Technology, meet talent.
* Meanwhile, another ham has ditched **day trading** in favor of **canasta club** and is reportedly doing far better there.

---

### 🧠 Riddle of the Night

**Riddle:** *“What is so fragile that saying its name breaks it?”*
**Answer:** *Silence.*

After a few rounds of head-scratching, someone quietly dropped the correct answer… **without even admitting it was an answer.** That subtlety earned full points. As one op put it:

> *“He said it. He didn’t say it was the answer, but we all know.”*

Bonus cultural tie-in: *The Sound of Silence* by Paul Simon. A few even added it to their backyard playlist for tomato tending.

---

### 🎩 The Pool Cue with a Story

In perhaps the most unexpected twist of the evening, one op offered to give away a **historic pool stick** salvaged from a now-closed bar in **Orange, NJ**—once the **hat capital of the world** and the birthplace of **John B. Stetson** (yes, *that* Stetson).

> *“You can meet me at Manhattan Bagel across from Turtle Back Zoo. I’ll buy you a bagel and coffee and give you the stick.”*

It’s not eBay, it’s better: it’s ham radio hospitality.

---

### 🚨 Bonus Tips & Bits

* A tip for Livingston-area scanner fans: **154.755 MHz** is still used by EMS and fire.
* One ham shared success getting a flat tire patched for \$15 after suspecting (correctly) that it was a leaking valve stem.

As dishes piled in the sink and net control eyed the clock, everyone had one last thought:

* Some were already prepping for tomorrow’s **WEARC meeting via Zoom**.
* Others were eyeing their tomato seedlings like overprotective parents.
* One person just wanted a sandwich.

And yes, the historic pool stick is still looking for a home.

* **40 meters**, known to propagate well across Essex County
* Integration using **modern radios with built-in sound cards**, or legacy radios with **SignalLink/DigiRig** interfaces

If successful, this could open up new digital options for local HF ragchews—**clearer audio, narrower bandwidth, and less noise.**

#### 📟 **Android & EchoLink Power Tips**

One participant shared a solution for an annoying problem: **Android devices dropping EchoLink connections** during low power or standby mode. [A brief technical write-up](/2023-11-22-echolink-support/#advanced) is available for anyone facing similar issues, particularly on **network radios** like the Inrico T320.

---

### 🧠 Riddle of the Week: Science Edition

> **“What scale is used to measure the hardness of minerals?”**
> *Answer: The Mohs Scale*

Despite early silence (fitting, perhaps), a correct answer eventually emerged. One participant's child remembered it from **seventh grade geology**, and another drew a clever line:
