### Community Net ML/GPT Generated Summary
- The SBARC Community Net is held weekly on Tuesdays, inviting hams from surrounding clubs to socialize, practice communication skills, and stay active on the air.

- A structured roundtable discussion followed, covering various topics including weather, personal updates, equipment sales, and emergency preparedness.

### Discussion Highlights

#### Weather & Seasonal Changes:
- Several participants discussed spring approaching, with temperatures rising in the region.
- A local groundhog (Lady Edwina at Turtleback Zoo) predicted an early spring.
- Melting snow and the first flowers blooming were noted by participants.

#### Ham Radio Events & Auctions:
- A recent New Providence auction was well attended, with praise for auctioneer Hillary, who efficiently handled the event.

#### Equipment for Sale & Giveaway:
- A Yaesu FTM-7250DR mobile radio was listed for $200.
- A branch cutter was offered for free to anyone interested.

#### Emergency Preparedness & Gasoline Supply Concerns:
- Extensive discussion on lessons from Hurricane Sandy, particularly gas station preparedness and backup power.
- Debate over New Jersey's full-service gas laws and whether gas stations should have backup generators.
- Some hams shared personal strategies:
  - Filling up both cars before a storm.
  - Keeping extra cash on hand due to potential ATM outages.
  - Having a siphon pump for extracting gas from vehicles in an emergency.

#### Power Outages & Home Heating Strategies:
- Several operators shared experiences of long power outages from past storms, with some homes losing power for up to three weeks.
- Participants discussed methods to stay warm, including:
  - Gas fireplaces & buddy heaters.
  - Hotel stays as a last resort.
  - Neighbors sharing power via extension cords.

#### Humor & Social Discussion:
- A joke was posed: "Why do leprechauns love to garden?"
  - Answer: "Because they have green thumbs."
- Some lighthearted banter about adjusting car clocks for daylight savings time, with creative "solutions" like disconnecting the battery at exactly 12:00 PM.

#### Moment of the Net:

The honor for the best moment of the net goes to **Maurice (KB2SUL)** for his hilarious suggestion on resetting the car clock:

> **"Just disconnect the battery at exactly 12:00 PM and reconnect itâ€”problem solved!"** 

Nice one, Maurice! ðŸŽ‰ðŸ”§ðŸš—

#### Final Thoughts:
- The net wrapped up with a reminder about emergency preparedness, including fuel, water, food, and cash.
